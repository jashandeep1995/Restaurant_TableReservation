The project's basis is an online ordering platform that customers are able to reserve the desired table and menu from a restaurant at their convenience.


Front End Technologies:

- PHP
- CSS 
- HTML

Backend Technologies:

- Used MySQL to retrieve the data from the backend.


Customer Functionalities

a. Search Menu according to the time of order delivery

- The main page will show after logging in, and customers can access the menu options there. Because product availability varies from time to time.

b. Allow to search menu according to category

- Customers may search the menu according to category; this capability will operate as a search criteria, i.e., the category will be the search criteria.

c. Allow to book order

- Allowing customer to place an order or to reserve a table.

d. Allow the customer to edit/create his personal account (membership)

- Customer can create his new account or he can edit his personal information from the existing account.

e. Allow customer an option to change his password

- Customers are given with a facility to change his existing password.

Management Functionalities:

a. Edit Menu records

- Admin can edit/create some or whole part of the menu record on daily basis. That is by changing the menu items, prices, description, etc.

b. Cancellation of the order

- Admin also has the functionality to cancel the order.

c. Create Teams’s list

- Admin can create a new entry of team or edit the existing teams’s information from the team’s list.

d. Blocking specific customer

- Before registering, an administrator can prohibit a specific user. When a customer has a poor track record, such as when he consistently fails to show up to pick up previously placed orders, this occurs.

e. some privileges 

- The privileges include editing the status of the order, i.e. he can enter the status as ready if he has completed that item or can change the order is in process before preparing that item.
